Text Classifier is a convenient tool designed for selecting text layers in a design project based on specific criteria. It offers users the ability to choose between text, numbers, and special characters, with an additional option to include punctuations as special characters.

<b>How it works</b>

Simply select all the layers you want it to analyze and click on the criteria and Text Classifier will select text layers that contain either text, numbers or special characters. If no layers are selected, the plugin will select all the layers on the page that match the criteria. 

<b>This plugin will only work if the layers are Text Layers. Text that are in vector shapes or images will not be detected.</b>
